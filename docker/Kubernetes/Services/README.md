# 📌 Kubernetes Services Overview

---

In Kubernetes, the main types of Services are:

- ✅ **ClusterIP**: Only accessible within the cluster.

- ✅ **NodePort**: Exposes the service on a fixed port of each node.

- ✅ **LoadBalancer**: Uses the cloud provider's load balancer.

- ✅ **ExternalName**: Redirects traffic to an external domain.

- ✅ **Headless (without ClusterIP)**: Allows direct service discovery (useful in StatefulSets).

## 🛠 Service Cluster IP for the Backend (API in Node.js, Python)

### 💡 Example: Cluster IP

  ```plaintext
  docker/
    Kubernetes/
     Services/
      ClusterIP.yml

  ```

## 🔗 Connecting the Backend to the Database in Code:

  ```plaintext
  DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://user:password@postgresql:5432/mydb"

  ```

## 🔧 Setting Database URL as an Environment Variable in the Backend Deployment:

  ```plaintext
  env:
  - name: DATABASE_URL
    value: "postgresql://user:password@postgresql:5432/mydb"

  ```

## 1️⃣ Service for the Frontend (if applicable)

If the frontend is a separate service (React, Angular, Vue):

### 💡 Example: ✅ LoadBalancer or Ingress Controller (Kong)

  ```plaintext
  docker/
    Kubernetes/
     Services/
      LoadBalancer.yml

  ```

## 2️⃣ Ingress Controller (for specific routes)

If you don't want a separate LoadBalancer for each service, you can use Ingress with NGINX or Traefik:

### 💡 Example: Ingress

  ```plaintext
  docker/
    Kubernetes/
     Services/
      Ingress.yml

  ```

---

### 📌 Conclusion

- **ClusterIP**= For internal communication between services.
- **LoadBalancer or Ingress** = To expose services to the internet.

---

### 📌 What Else Might You Need?

- **ServiceMonitor** (if using Prometheus for metrics).

- **ExternalName** (if connecting to an external API).

- **Headless Service** (for StatefulSets, such as a distributed database).
