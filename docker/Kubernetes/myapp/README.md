Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the deployment of applications in a controlled manner. This guide provides a basic example of how to create a Helm chart to deploy your application.

## 📁 Basic Helm Chart Structure

  ```plaintext
  myapp/
    Chart.yaml
    values.yaml
    templates/
      deployment.yaml
      service.yaml

  ```
