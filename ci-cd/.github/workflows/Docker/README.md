# 🏃 Understanding Runtime in Docker and CI/CD

---

## 📌 Key Differences

1️⃣ **General Runtime**

A runtime is the execution environment where an application runs. This includes the interpreter, libraries, and system dependencies required for the code to function.

2️⃣ **Runtime in Docker**

In the context of Docker, the runtime refers to the engine that runs containers (such as `containerd` or `runc`). It can also refer to the dependencies within a container needed to run an application, such as `python:3.9` or `node:18`.

3️⃣ **Runtime in CI/CD (GitHub Actions)**

- If you use Docker in CI, the GitHub Actions runner pulls the image and uses it as the runtime to execute the application.

- If you use a runner without Docker, the runtime is the system where the application executes (a VM with Node.js installed).

### 💡 Example: GitHub Actions with Docker

  ```plaintext
  ci-cd/
    .github/
     workflows/
      Docker/
        Docker.yml

  ```

In this case, the Docker image serves as the execution environment (runtime) for the application within the CI/CD pipeline.

### 📌 Conclusion

The runtime is the environment where the application runs, whether inside a **Docker container (image)**, a **virtual machine (VM)**, or a **physical machine**.
